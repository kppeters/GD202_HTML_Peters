            <p class="w3-text-grey"> Bland with fluorescent lighting. Has a slightly higher noise level in this location as it is lunch hour. A lot of foot traffic. The people in the area are very studious but are taking a more casual approach during this time. There are unique egg-chairs and other unique pieces of furniture. There are glass walls. On the opposite side of the glass wall there is a room filled with tables that each seat 4-6 people. There are two couches in a “lobby” area with a coffee table. being near the entrance there is a lack of serious and dedicated studying and rather a more casual and social environment. The deeper you go, the more serious and quieter the environment becomes.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey"> This area is less crowded and almost peaceful compared to the other location. Students were taking their work more professionally. There are large wooden pieces of furniture with gold accents around that add to the serious tone of the space. This is not a popular area as there is not a designated workspace but rather a large rounded and wooden bench near a large window. There were a few displays and exhibits around making it almost feel like a modern museum. This seems like a spot to relax rather than study or socialize.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">While observing a group of four males from an egg chair across from them, I found them to be very social while completing what seems to be coursework. Some are referencing their laptops while others clean the space around them. One is snacking on food from the Atrium while chatting about their new classes and the assigned homework. Their bags are mostly on the ground. About 10 minutes in, they are now relaxing and just socializing without urgency to complete the assignment.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Observing a boy and a girl from a chair across the round bench. The couple is chatting very quietly. The boy seems to be reading articles while the girl takes notes. The two of them are enjoying the scenery more than getting their work done. They are laughing and smiling silently. The boy switches now between watching a video and texting. At this point, the two of them begin packing up. They were cleaning their computers, phones, notebooks, and backpacks. There was no room for a large study group to be around the pair, only individuals to sit on the bench.</p>
